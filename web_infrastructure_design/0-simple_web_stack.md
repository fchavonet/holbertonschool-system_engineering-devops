# Simple web stack

## üìÑ Description

This is the diagram of a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via `www.foobar.com`.

It contains one global server (IP: 8.8.8.8) with one web server (NGINX), one application server, application files (code base) and one database (MySQL).

## üéì Specifics about this infrastructure

- **What is a server?**

    It's a computer or system responsible for providing services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In this case, it hosts the website for www.foobar.com.

- **What is the role of the domain name?**

    In this case, "foobar.com," is a human-readable address that allows users to access the website. It acts as a user-friendly reference to the server's IP address.

- **What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?**

    The "www" is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record, which is an alias for the domain name, directing it to the server's IP address.

- **What is the role of the web server?**

    The web server (NGINX) handles incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers. It serves static content, like HTML and CSS files, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

- **What is the role of the application server?**

    It runs the web application's code and processes dynamic requests, generating content and responses to be served by the web server.

- **What is the role of the database?**

    The MySQL database stores and manages the website's data, such as user accounts, content, and other structured information, which the application server accesses and modifies.

- **What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?**

    The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP protocol, which is the standard for web communication. It sends and receives HTTP requests and responses.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with this infrastructure

- There are multiple SPOF (Single Point Of Failure) in this web infrastructure.
For example, if the application server or the database is down, the entire site would be down.

- When updates or maintenance are needed, the web server may need to be restarted, causing downtime for users during that period.

- This infrastructure cannot easily handle a sudden increase in traffic. To scale, additional servers and load balancing mechanisms would be required.
